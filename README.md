# Enigma Machine Emulator

The **Enigma machine**, used by Nazi Germany during World War II, was designed to secure communications by making messages nearly impossible to decode without the correct key. Each time a key was pressed, the rotors shifted, altering the encryption for every letter typed. This dynamic process added an extra layer of security.

This project is a **virtual Enigma machine emulator** that replicates the encryption process of the **Enigma M3 series**, which was used by the German Navy (Kriegsmarine).

## Getting Started

Before you can use the keyboard section of the machine, you need to configure the necessary settings:

1. **Set Rotor Positions:** Click on the rotors to adjust their initial settings.
2. **Plugboard Connections:** In the lower section of the machine, you can make the required connections by clicking on the plugs to connect letters.

Once the settings are applied, you can start typing and experience how the encryption worked in the past.
